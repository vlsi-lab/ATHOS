# get started

## 1. OS requirements

To use `X-HEEP`, first make sure you have the following apt packages, or install them as:

```bash
sudo apt install lcov libelf1 libelf-dev libftdi1-2 libftdi1-dev libncurses5 libssl-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 lsb-release texinfo autoconf cmake flex bison libexpat-dev gawk tree xterm python3-venv python3-dev
```

In general, have a look at the [Install required software](https://opentitan.org/guides/getting_started/index.html) section of the OpenTitan documentation.

It has been tested only on `Ubuntu 20`, and we know it does NOT WORK on `Ubuntu 22`.

## 2. Python


We rely on either (a) `miniconda`, or (b) `virtual environment` enviroment.

Choose between `2.a` or `2.b` to setup your enviroment.

### 2.a Miniconda

Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) python 3.8 version as described in the link,
and create the Conda enviroment:

```bash
make conda
```

You need to do it only the first time, then just activate the environment everytime you work with `X-HEEP` as

```bash
conda activate core-v-mini-mcu
```


### 2.b Virtual Environment

Install the python virtual environment just as:

```bash
make venv
```

You need to do it only the first time, then just activate the environment everytime you work with `X-HEEP` as

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install the RISC-V Compiler:

```
git clone --branch 2022.01.17 --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/tools/riscv --with-abi=ilp32 --with-arch=rv32imc --with-cmodel=medlow
make
```

Then, set the `RISCV` env variable as:

```
export RISCV=/home/$USER/tools/riscv
```

Optionally you can also compile with clang/LLVM instead of gcc. For that you must install the clang compiler into the same `RISCV` path. The binaries of gcc and clang do not collide so you can have both residing in the same `RISCV` directory. For this you can set the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` cmake variable to `$RISCV` when building LLVM. This can be accomplished by doing the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout llvmorg-14.0.0
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$RISCV -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="RISCV" ../llvm
cmake --build . --target install
```

## 4. Install Verilator:

```
export VERILATOR_VERSION=4.210

git clone https://github.com/verilator/verilator.git
cd verilator
git checkout v$VERILATOR_VERSION

autoconf
./configure --prefix=/home/$USER/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION
make
make install
```
Then, set the `PATH` env variable to as:

```
export PATH=/home/$USER/tools/verilator/$VERILATOR_VERSION/bin:$PATH
```

In general, have a look at the [Install Verilator](https://opentitan.org/guides/getting_started/setup_verilator.html) section of the OpenTitan documentation.

If you want to see the vcd waveforms generated by the Verilator simulation, install GTKWAVE:

```
sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
sudo apt-get install -y gtkwave
```

## Files are formatted with Verible

We use version v0.0-1824-ga3b5bedf

See: [Install Verible](https://opentitan.org/guides/getting_started/index.html#step-6a-install-verible-optional)

To format your RTL code type:

```
make verible
```
## Compilation Flow and Package Manager

We use [FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) for all the tools we use.

The `fusesoc` commands are inside the Makefile.
